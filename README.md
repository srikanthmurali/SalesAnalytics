**Goal**: To predict customer profiles based on region, month, and product category for the year 2022, using a machine learning model trained on data from the year 2021. This analysis will help determine staffing requirements for the year 2022

Let's compare the financial data from the annual reports for the years 2021-22 and 2022-23 to identify improvements, areas that need attention, and any notable changes or pain points:

**Key Comparisons:**

1. **Revenue (Income from Operations):**
   - 2021-22: 48 million
   - 2022-23: 68 million
   - **Improvement:** Revenue from operations increased by approximately 20 million, indicating significant growth in the company's core business activities.
     
2. . **Number of Employees:**
   - 2021-22: 1866
   - 2022-23: 1596
   - **Change:** The number of employees slightly decreased, which may have been a strategic decision.
  
**Areas to Focus and Potential Pain Points:**

1. **Expenditure Increase:** While revenue increased significantly, so did the company's expenditure, especially in categories like staff cost and other expenditure. It's essential to manage and control expenses to ensure sustained profitability.
2. **Employee Headcount:** Monitoring and managing the number of employees is important to control labor costs and maintain efficiency.

So I have synthesized the data for various product categories, region, staff quantity, staff cost, units used, unit per cost etc to show the various observation on a historical data using CRISP DM Framework to identify any best practice happened historically and any anomalous behaviour as well which can be a room for improvement.
